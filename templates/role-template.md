## Template Usage Notes

### Structure

All roles follow this simple structure:
1. **In Short**: 2-3 sentences + typical experience
2. **Scope**: Time Horizon, Ownership, Impact (1 line each)
3. **What Good Looks Like**: Organized by the 3 core competencies (Craft, Impact, Leadership)
4. **Ready for Next Level When**: 4-6 specific behavioral indicators

### Using the Three Competencies

The "What Good Looks Like" section is organized by our three core competencies. Each competency has:
- **Header**: Competency name
- **Italic description**: The standard definition from competencies.md
- **Bullets**: 4-6 specific behaviors for this role level

**Craft** focuses on:
- Technical skills and quality
- Problem-solving approaches
- Learning and growth
- Patterns and standards

**Impact** focuses on:
- Ownership and delivery
- Client value creation
- Communication and follow-through
- Scope of work

**Leadership** focuses on:
- Growing and helping others
- Sharing knowledge
- Influencing team/organization
- Culture building

### General Principles

- **Be specific and concrete**, not vague or aspirational
- **Use active, behavioral language** that describes what you do
- **Keep it simple** - target 50-75 lines total per role
- **Trust engineers to ask questions** rather than documenting every edge case
- **Tie back to competencies** - every behavior should map to Craft, Impact, or Leadership

### Adapting for Different Levels

As roles progress, behaviors expand in each competency:

**Craft progression:**
- Software Engineer: Learn and apply
- Senior: Set standards and make trade-offs
- Principal: Design systems and drive discovery
- Distinguished: Shape strategy and define standards

**Impact progression:**
- Software Engineer: Complete tasks → features
- Senior: Own features → projects
- Principal: Own projects → products
- Distinguished: Own products → company

**Leadership progression:**
- Software Engineer: Learn and support
- Senior: Coach and mentor actively
- Principal: Multiply teams
- Distinguished: Multiply organization

### Consistency Matters

- Use the same three competency headers and descriptions across all roles
- Keep the structure identical (In Short → Scope → What Good Looks Like → Ready for Next Level)
- Make progression clear by showing how behaviors expand
- Enable easy comparison across roles
