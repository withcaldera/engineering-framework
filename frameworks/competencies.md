## How to Use This Framework

- **Competencies** are areas where all engineers need to develop skill
- **Progression** within each competency reflects increasing scope, ownership, and impact
- **Role definitions** describe how these competencies manifest at each level
- **Growth** happens by demonstrating competency at the next level consistently

You don't need to excel at everything to grow. But you should be strong across competencies and exceptional in areas relevant to your role and impact.
