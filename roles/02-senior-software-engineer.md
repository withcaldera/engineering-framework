# Senior Software Engineer

## In Short

You're a force multiplier. You own the delivery process for features and projects, from ambiguous requirements to production. You set technical direction, mentor others, and strengthen both client relationships and internal practices.

---

## Scope

- **Time Horizon**: You focus on 1-3 month features and projects, planning ahead to deliver cohesive solutions that create sustained value.

- **Ownership**: You own delivery and solution discovery. You're given problems and expected to discover the right solutions. You design approaches, make technical decisions, and ensure successful delivery.

- **Impact**: Your scope of impact expands from features to full projects. You deliver complete projects that may span multiple features and require coordination across the team.

## What Good Looks Like

### Craft
*Building excellent software through technical skill, judgment, and continuous learning.*

- Write exemplary code that sets standards
- Design features and small systems end-to-end
- Make and document architectural decisions
- Make thoughtful architectural trade-offs balancing speed and quality
- Demonstrate depth in relevant areas
- Leave code better than you found it
- Adopt and evangelize tools that multiply team effectiveness

### Impact
*Taking ownership, delivering outcomes, and creating value for clients and Caldera.*

- Own outcomes, not just outputs
- Drive features to completion, removing blockers for yourself and others
- Proactively identify and solve problems before they escalate
- Build features that exceed expectations
- Deeply understand client problems and constraints
- Improve team practices and delivery speed proactively
- Make clear, documented decisions with group consentâ€”don't let decision paralysis become the bottleneck

### Leadership
*Growing others, building shared understanding, and multiplying effectiveness.*

- Actively coach less experienced engineers
- Provide detailed, educational feedback in code reviews
- Help others grow through pairing and guidance
- Lead technical discussions effectively
- Set example through your work
- Share learnings that elevate the team

## Examples

You're operating at this level when people see you doing these things:

- Writing technical design documents for features that others review and reference for months afterward
- Leading public technical discussions (Slack threads, design reviews) where you present trade-offs and drive decisions with consent
- Proactively posting project updates that show how you're unblocking others and driving toward delivery
- Sharing pairing sessions or code walkthroughs where less experienced engineers are learning from you
- Publishing retrospectives or incident reports that capture learnings and improve team practices
- Demonstrating how new tools or approaches helped deliver a project faster while maintaining or improving quality

*In a remote organization, your work must be visible to be valued. These are the observable signals that you're delivering at this level.*

## Ready for Principal When...

You consistently demonstrate these behaviors over 6+ months:

- **Planning and delivering 3-6 month projects** (not just 1-3 month features)
- **Owning solution discovery consistently** and beginning to identify problems worth solving
- **Influencing technical strategy** across multiple projects
- **Other engineers seek your input** on technical decisions
- **Solving problems that span** multiple clients or projects
- **Thinking about long-term technical health**, not just immediate delivery

**Note**: Most engineers reach Principal level with 4-8 years total experience.
