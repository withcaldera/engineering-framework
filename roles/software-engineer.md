## Example Scenarios

**Executing on a Feature**
- Receive: "Build a password reset email feature using our email service"
- You: Implement the feature, write tests, handle errors, create the PR, respond to feedback, merge and verify in staging

**Handling Ambiguity**
- Situation: Requirement says "user-friendly error messages" but doesn't specify format
- You: Ask for clarification with 2-3 examples of what you're considering, then implement based on feedback

**Being Blocked**
- Situation: API endpoint you need isn't working
- You: Try basic debugging, check documentation, then reach out with context: "I'm working on X, need API Y, tried Z, getting error A. Could you help?"

**Contributing to Culture**
- Review a teammate's PR thoughtfully
- Share a useful article or tool with the team
- Ask good questions in planning meetings
- Celebrate team wins in Slack
