# Senior Software Engineer

## Overview

Senior Software Engineers are force multipliers. You own the delivery process for features and small projects, from ambiguous requirements to production. You set technical direction, mentor others, and strengthen both client relationships and internal practices.

---

## Scope & Responsibilities

### Time Horizon
**1-2 weeks** — You plan and deliver feature sets and small projects, thinking beyond individual tasks.

### Problem Space
**Delivery Process** — You're given a problem and direction. You define the solution, break down the work, and deliver results.

### Impact Radius
**Features → Projects** — Your work creates cohesive solutions that solve significant client problems.

- Balance pragmatism with technical excellence

### Transparency & Working in Public
- Share design decisions and trade-offs openly
- Document not just what, but why
- Make your work a learning resource for others
- Communicate progress, challenges, and learnings regularly

### Mentorship
- Actively coach less experienced engineers
- Provide detailed, educational code reviews
- Help others grow through pairing and guidance
- Share your knowledge through documentation and discussion

### Client Impact
- Deeply understand client problems and constraints
- Propose solutions that balance client needs and technical quality
- Build features that exceed expectations
- Represent engineering perspective in client discussions

### Internal Impact

## Growth Indicators

You're ready to operate at the Principal level when you:

### Expanding Scope
- Planning and delivering month-long projects, not just week-long features
- Owning solution discovery, not just delivery process
- Influencing technical strategy across multiple projects
- Thinking about long-term technical health, not just immediate delivery

### Deeper Leadership
- Other engineers seek your input on technical decisions
- Your architectural decisions become team patterns
- You're developing technical vision, not just executing on it
- You're shaping how the team approaches problems

### Broader Impact
- Your work influences Caldera's technical direction
- You're solving problems that span multiple clients or projects
- You're building capabilities and platforms, not just features
- You're known for specific areas of expertise

### Strategic Thinking
- You identify problems before they're assigned
- You connect technical work to business outcomes
- You influence what we build, not just how we build it
- You're thinking about team capabilities and growth

## Example Scenarios

**Owning a Feature Set**
- Receive: "Client needs to improve their onboarding flow — users are confused and dropping off"
- You: Research the problem, propose solutions, design the technical approach, break down work, implement complex parts, guide others on remaining work, monitor impact post-launch

**Navigating Ambiguity**
- Situation: Client wants "better performance" but can't specify what's slow
- You: Instrument the system, identify bottlenecks, propose targeted improvements with expected impact, implement and measure results

**Technical Leadership**
- Situation: Team is inconsistent in handling async operations
- You: Research patterns, propose an approach, document it, implement examples, review others' implementations, iterate based on feedback

**Mentoring**
- Situation: Junior engineer is struggling with a complex feature
- You: Pair with them to understand the problem, ask questions that guide their thinking, review their approach, provide specific feedback, help them succeed while learning

**Client Interaction**
- Situation: Client asks for a feature that would create technical debt
- You: Understand the underlying need, propose alternatives that meet the need without compromising quality, explain trade-offs clearly, build trust through transparency
