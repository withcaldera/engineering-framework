## Distinguished vs Principal

The distinction is primarily about scope, discovery, and organizational impact:

**Problem Space**
- Principal: Solution discovery (given problem → discover solution)
- Distinguished: Problem discovery (find problem → solution → delivery)

**Time & Scope**
- Principal: 1-2 month projects
- Distinguished: 3-6 month products and initiatives

**Impact**
- Principal: Project/product level
- Distinguished: Product/company level

**Leadership**
- Principal: Leading teams through technical excellence
- Distinguished: Shaping organizational capabilities and strategy

**Orientation**
- Principal: Deep technical expertise applied to complex problems
- Distinguished: Technical strategy connected to business outcomes

Both roles require exceptional technical skill. Distinguished adds strategic problem discovery, broader organizational impact, and responsibility for Caldera's technical direction.
