# Principal Software Engineer

## Overview

Principal Software Engineers are technical leaders who operate at the project level. You discover and define solutions to complex problems, set technical direction for significant initiatives, and multiply the impact of entire teams. You balance deep technical expertise with strategic thinking and leadership. You continue to execute, deliver, and discover solutions while expanding into problem discovery.

**Typical Experience**: 4-8 years

---

## Scope & Responsibilities

### Time Horizon
**3-6 months** — You plan and deliver projects that span multiple features and systems, thinking strategically about the medium-term future.

### Ownership
**Solution Discovery → Problem Discovery** — You start by being given problems to solve while you discover and define solutions (solution discovery), and transition into identifying problems worth solving (problem discovery). You continue to execute and deliver on features and projects.

### Scope
**Projects → Products** — You start with projects and transition into owning entire products. Your work creates coherent products and capabilities that transform how clients operate.

## Example Scenarios

**Solution Discovery**
- Receive: "Client's system can't scale to their growth projections — they're worried it will collapse"
- You: Analyze the system deeply, identify bottlenecks and root causes, evaluate multiple approaches (scale up, scale out, redesign, hybrid), prototype critical unknowns, design solution with migration path, document trade-offs, lead implementation with team

**Technical Leadership**
- Situation: Multiple projects are solving similar problems differently, creating fragmentation
- You: Identify the pattern, research best approaches, design a unified solution, build consensus across teams, create migration path, implement core capability, support adoption across projects

**Navigating Complexity**
- Situation: Project involves three legacy systems, two external APIs, compliance requirements, and aggressive timeline
- You: Break down into phases, identify risks, create proof-of-concepts for unknowns, design integration architecture, sequence work to reduce risk, adapt plan as you learn, drive to completion

**Strategic Client Engagement**
- Situation: Client CTO is considering major technology shift
- You: Understand their drivers and constraints, evaluate options thoroughly, provide honest assessment with evidence, propose alternatives they hadn't considered, help them make informed decision aligned with their goals

**Building Leverage**
- Situation: Multiple teams repeatedly solving authentication/authorization differently
- You: Design and build shared authentication platform, document clearly, migrate first project, support adoption, enable teams to move faster while improving security

**Mentoring Leaders**
- Situation: Senior Engineer is ready to grow but struggling with project planning
- You: Work with them on their next project, teach them your approach to breaking down complex problems, review their plans, provide specific feedback, let them drive while you guide, help them succeed and grow
