## Head of Engineering vs Distinguished

**Critical Understanding**: Both roles shape strategy and organizational capability. Head of Engineering adds responsibility for entire organization, business partnership, and external representation.

**Ownership & Scope**
- Distinguished: 6-12 months, Products → Company
- Head of Engineering: 12-24+ months, Company → Market

**Leadership Focus**
- Distinguished: Shape organizational capabilities and strategy
- Head of Engineering: Build and scale the entire organization

**Responsibility**
- Distinguished: Lead transformational initiatives
- Head of Engineering: Own all engineering outcomes

A Head of Engineering still drives technical strategy and may lead initiatives—they do everything a Distinguished Engineer does PLUS own the entire organization, team, and culture.

## Relationship to Other Roles

- **Software Engineers**: Clear expectations, good onboarding, supportive culture
- **Senior Engineers**: Opportunities to lead, mentorship, growth paths
- **Principal Engineers**: Strategic projects, autonomy, impact opportunities
- **Distinguished Engineers**: Company-level challenges, executive access, external opportunities

You develop engineering leaders who make you less necessary over time.
