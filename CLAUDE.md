# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is Caldera's Engineering Framework - a documentation repository that defines clear expectations for engineering roles, growth, and impact. It contains:

- **Role definitions** for 5 engineering levels (Software Engineer through Head of Engineering)
- **Core competencies** framework (Craft, Impact, Leadership)
- **Templates** for creating consistent role documentation
- **Philosophy and principles** for engineering growth at Caldera

This is a documentation-only repository with no build system, tests, or runtime code.

## Content Architecture

### Three Core Competencies

All role definitions are structured around three competencies:

1. **Craft** - Building excellent software through technical skill, judgment, and continuous learning
2. **Impact** - Taking ownership, delivering outcomes, and creating value for clients and Caldera
3. **Leadership** - Growing others, building shared understanding, and multiplying effectiveness

### Three Dimensions of Growth

The framework defines growth along three expanding dimensions:

- **Time Horizon**: How far ahead you work (1-2 weeks → 6-12 months)
- **Ownership**: What you discover (execution → delivery → solutions → problems)
- **Scope**: Where you create value (tasks → features → projects → products → company)

### Role Definition Structure

Every role document follows this exact structure:

1. **In Short** - 2-3 sentence overview
2. **Scope** - Time Horizon, Ownership, Impact (one line each)
3. **What Good Looks Like** - Organized by Craft, Impact, Leadership competencies (4-6 bullets each)
4. **Examples** - 3-5 observable behaviors demonstrating the role
5. **Ready for [Next Level] When** - 4-6 behavioral indicators for promotion readiness

## Working with Role Documents

### Consistency Requirements

- All role documents MUST use identical section structure
- The three competency headers and italic descriptions are standardized across all roles
- Keep role documents concise (target 50-75 lines)
- Use active, behavioral language that describes what people do

### Observable Behaviors

The "Examples" section in each role emphasizes **visibility in a remote organization**. Examples should:

- Describe concrete actions others can witness (e.g., "Posting pull requests with clear descriptions...")
- Focus on observable artifacts and communications
- Reinforce the principle: "Your work must be visible to be valued"

### Progression Patterns

When editing roles, maintain clear progression:

- **Craft**: Learn → Set standards → Design systems → Shape strategy
- **Impact**: Tasks → Features → Projects → Products → Company
- **Leadership**: Learn/support → Coach → Multiply teams → Multiply organization

## Key Principles

### Growth Through Demonstration
"You earn responsibilities before titles. Engineers demonstrate readiness for the next level by consistently operating at that level."

### Working Visibly in Remote Organizations
Multiple sections emphasize visibility, documentation, and working in public. This is a core cultural value that should be reflected throughout role definitions.

### Extreme Ownership
A key value emphasizing owning outcomes (not just outputs) and following through end-to-end.

### Dual Impact
Engineers create value for both clients AND Caldera. Both matter equally.

## Editing Guidelines

When modifying role documents:

1. Maintain the exact structure defined in [role-template.md](templates/role-template.md)
2. Keep competency definitions consistent with [competencies.md](competencies.md)
3. Ensure behaviors are specific, concrete, and observable
4. Verify progression is clear when comparing adjacent role levels
5. Keep language simple and direct - avoid jargon or vague aspirational statements
6. Ensure "Examples" section shows visible behaviors for remote work context

## Common Scope Definitions

- **Task**: Discrete work completed in days
- **Feature**: User-facing capability (1-2 weeks, multiple tasks)
- **Project**: Coordinated effort (1-3 months, multiple features)
- **Product**: Complete offering evolving over quarters/years
- **Company**: Strategic initiatives impacting multiple products or entire business
