# Principal Software Engineer

## In Short

You're a technical leader operating at the project level. You discover and define solutions to complex problems, set technical direction for significant initiatives, and multiply the impact of entire teams. You balance deep technical expertise with strategic thinking and leadership.

---

## Scope

- **Time Horizon**: You focus on 3-6 month projects and products, thinking strategically about how initiatives evolve and create long-term impact.

- **Ownership**: You own solution discovery and begin identifying problems. You discover solutions to complex problems and start recognizing important problems that need solving before they're escalated to you.

- **Impact**: Your scope of impact grows from projects to products. You shape entire products or major product areas, ensuring they deliver value over quarters.

## Examples

You're operating at this level when people see you doing these things:

- Publishing architecture decision records (ADRs) that shape how multiple teams build systems for months
- Actively participating in client strategy meetings where your technical input is visible and influences their roadmap
- Posting mentorship threads or documentation where you're teaching Senior Engineers how to approach system design
- Presenting quarterly technical strategy updates that show how your projects are delivering sustained value
- Creating and sharing reusable patterns, libraries, or tools that other teams visibly adopt and reference
- Evangelizing new capabilities (like AI-powered development tools or CI/CD improvements) that measurably improve team velocity

*In a remote organization, your work must be visible to be valued. These are the observable signals that you're delivering at this level.*
