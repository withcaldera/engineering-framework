# Caldera Engineering Framework

This repository defines how we think about engineering roles, growth, and impact at Caldera. It provides clear expectations for every level, from Software Engineer through Distinguished, along with the competencies and behaviors that drive career progression.

## What's Inside

### üìã Role Definitions
Clear descriptions of scope, responsibilities, and expectations for each engineering level:
- **[Software Engineer](roles/software-engineer.md)** ‚Äî Execute and deliver on well-defined problems (fresh/bootcamp)
- **[Senior Software Engineer](roles/senior-software-engineer.md)** ‚Äî Own delivery and discover solutions (2-4 years experience)
- **[Principal Software Engineer](roles/principal-software-engineer.md)** ‚Äî Discover solutions and identify problems (4-8 years experience)
- **[Distinguished Software Engineer](roles/distinguished-software-engineer.md)** ‚Äî Discover problems and shape company strategy (8-10+ years experience)
- **[Head of Engineering](roles/head-of-engineering.md)** ‚Äî Lead the engineering organization

### üéØ Core Frameworks
- **[Core Competencies](frameworks/competencies.md)** ‚Äî The 10 competency areas where all engineers develop
- **[Progression Matrix](frameworks/progression-matrix.md)** ‚Äî Side-by-side comparison across all levels

### üõ†Ô∏è Templates
- **[Role Template](templates/role-template.md)** ‚Äî Template for creating new role definitions

## Our Engineering Philosophy

### Core Principles

### Growth Through Demonstration
We believe in **earning responsibilities before titles**. Engineers demonstrate readiness for the next level by consistently operating at that level. Title changes recognize what you're already doing, not unlock what you might do.

### Increasing Scope & Ownership
As engineers grow, three dimensions expand simultaneously:

#### Time Horizon ‚Äî How far ahead you work

    T2[<b>Senior</b><br/>1-3 months<br/>features & feature sets]
    T3[<b>Principal</b><br/>3-6 months<br/>projects]
    T4[<b>Distinguished</b><br/>6-12 months<br/>products & company strategy]
    T1 ==> T2 ==> T3 ==> T4

    style T3 stroke:#2563eb,stroke-width:3px
    style T4 stroke:#2563eb,stroke-width:3px
```

As engineers grow, their planning horizon extends significantly:

- **Software Engineer**: Plan and execute 1-2 weeks of work, delivering individual tasks and features
- **Senior Engineer**: Plan and execute 1-3 months of work, coordinating features and small projects
- **Principal Engineer**: Plan and execute 3-6 months of work, orchestrating entire projects with multiple moving parts
- **Distinguished Engineer**: Plan and execute 6-12 months of work, shaping products and strategic initiatives that define the company's direction

#### Ownership ‚Äî What you're responsible for discovering

```mermaid

    P2[<b>Delivery Process</b><br/>‚Üí Solution Discovery]
    P3[<b>Solution Discovery</b><br/>‚Üí Problem Discovery]
    P4[<b>Problem Discovery</b><br/>+ All Below]
    P1 ==> P2 ==> P3 ==> P4

    style P1 stroke:#7c3aed,stroke-width:3px
    style P2 stroke:#7c3aed,stroke-width:3px
    style P3 stroke:#7c3aed,stroke-width:3px
    style P4 stroke:#7c3aed,stroke-width:3px
```

The ownership you take expands with each level, building on everything before:

- **Software Engineer**: Start with execution (given problem + solution) and transition into delivery process (given problem + direction)
- **Senior Engineer**: Start with delivery process and transition into solution discovery (given problem, you discover the solution)
- **Principal Engineer**: Start with solution discovery and transition into problem discovery (you identify problems worth solving)
- **Distinguished Engineer**: Own problem discovery while continuing to execute, deliver, and discover solutions

**Important**: Each level adds new responsibilities without replacing previous ones. A Distinguished Engineer still executes, delivers, discovers solutions, AND discovers problems.

#### Scope ‚Äî Where your work creates value

```mermaid

    I1[<b>Tasks</b><br/>‚Üí Features]
    I2[<b>Features</b><br/>‚Üí Projects]
    I3[<b>Projects</b><br/>‚Üí Products]
    I4[<b>Products</b><br/>‚Üí Company]
    I1 ==> I2 ==> I3 ==> I4

    style I1 stroke:#ea580c,stroke-width:3px
    style I2 stroke:#ea580c,stroke-width:3px
    style I3 stroke:#ea580c,stroke-width:3px
    style I4 stroke:#ea580c,stroke-width:3px
```

Your scope of work expands with each level, building concentrically:

- **Software Engineer**: Start with tasks and transition into owning features
- **Senior Engineer**: Start with features and transition into owning projects
- **Principal Engineer**: Start with projects and transition into owning products
- **Distinguished Engineer**: Start with products and transition into owning company strategy

**Important**: Each level adds broader scope without abandoning the previous ones. A Distinguished Engineer still owns tasks, features, projects, products, AND company strategy.

### Extreme Ownership
You own your work end-to-end. This means:
- Taking responsibility for outcomes, not just outputs
- Proactively identifying and solving problems
- Following through until value is delivered
- Asking for help when needed, but driving resolution

### Dual Impact: Client & Internal
As a consultancy, we measure success on two fronts:
- **Client Impact**: Solving real problems, delivering value, building trust
- **Internal Impact**: Strengthening our team, improving our craft, building Caldera's reputation

Both matter. Great engineers create value for clients while elevating the entire team.

### Transparency & Working in Public
We default to open:
- Share work-in-progress, not just finished products
- Document decisions and trade-offs
- Make knowledge accessible to the team
- Learn and build in the open

### Culture Building
Every engineer is a culture carrier. We actively shape Caldera through:
- How we communicate with clients and each other
- The quality bar we set
- How we mentor and support teammates
- The practices and standards we establish

### Peer Accountability
We hold each other to high standards with kindness:
- Give direct, constructive feedback
- Challenge ideas, not people
- Support each other's growth
- Celebrate wins and learn from setbacks together

## How This Guides Our Roles

Each role definition reflects these principles:
- **Scope expectations** are clear but not limiting
- **Behaviors** are described, not just responsibilities
- **Growth paths** show what "operating at the next level" looks like
- **Impact** is measured on both client and internal dimensions

You don't wait for a promotion to start working at the next level. You work at the next level to earn the promotion.

## How to Use This Framework

### For Engineers
1. Read your current role definition to understand expectations
2. Review the progression matrix to see the path ahead
3. Read the next level's role definition to understand what growth looks like
4. Use the competency framework to assess and develop yourself
5. Have career conversations with your manager using this shared language

### For Managers
1. Use role definitions to set clear expectations
2. Assess engineers against competencies at their level
3. Identify engineers consistently operating at the next level
4. Provide specific, behavioral feedback tied to the framework
5. Create opportunities for engineers to demonstrate next-level capabilities

### For Everyone
Remember: This framework makes expectations clear, but growth happens through demonstration. You earn the next level by consistently operating at that level. Title changes recognize what you're already doing.
