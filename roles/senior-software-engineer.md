# Senior Software Engineer

## In Short

You're a force multiplier. You own the delivery process for features and projects, from ambiguous requirements to production. You set technical direction, mentor others, and strengthen both client relationships and internal practices.

**Typical Experience**: 2-4 years

---

## Scope

- **Time Horizon**: 1-3 months
- **Ownership**: Delivery → Solution Discovery (given problem + direction, then just problem)
- **Impact**: Features → Projects

- Establish patterns others follow

**Multiply the team**
- Actively coach less experienced engineers
- Provide detailed, educational code reviews
- Help others grow through pairing and guidance

## Ready for Principal When...

You consistently demonstrate these behaviors over 6+ months:

- **Planning and delivering 3-6 month projects** (not just 1-3 month features)
- **Owning solution discovery consistently** and beginning to identify problems worth solving
- **Influencing technical strategy** across multiple projects
- **Other engineers seek your input** on technical decisions
- **Solving problems that span** multiple clients or projects
- **Thinking about long-term technical health**, not just immediate delivery

**Note**: Most engineers reach Principal level with 4-8 years total experience.
