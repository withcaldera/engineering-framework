## Example Scenarios

**Strategic Decision**
- Situation: Technology choice with multi-year implications
- You: Deeply understand options and trade-offs, consult experts, consider business and technical factors, make decision with clear reasoning, communicate transparently, own the outcome

**Organizational Challenge**
- Situation: Engineering velocity declining as team grows
- You: Diagnose root causes, design systemic solutions, build buy-in, drive implementation, measure improvement, iterate based on results

**People Development**
- Situation: High-potential engineer struggling in new role
- You: Provide clear feedback, create support structure, adjust responsibilities if needed, coach and mentor, make tough calls if necessary

**Client Escalation**
- Situation: Major client dissatisfied with technical delivery
- You: Understand client perspective deeply, take ownership, create recovery plan, communicate transparently, restore trust, address systemic causes

**Resource Allocation**
- Situation: More opportunities than engineering capacity
- You: Evaluate against strategy, consider client and internal impact, make difficult trade-offs, communicate decisions clearly, ensure chosen work succeeds

**Culture Issue**
- Situation: Behavior undermining engineering culture
- You: Address directly and quickly, clarify expectations, provide support for change, protect culture, make difficult people decisions when necessary

## Relationship to Other Roles

You create conditions for every role to succeed:

- **Software Engineers**: Clear expectations, good onboarding, supportive culture
- **Senior Engineers**: Opportunities to lead, mentorship, growth paths
- **Principal Engineers**: Strategic projects, autonomy, impact opportunities
- **Distinguished Engineers**: Company-level challenges, executive access, external opportunities

You develop engineering leaders who make you less necessary over time.
