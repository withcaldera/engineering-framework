# Caldera Engineering Framework

Clear expectations for engineering roles, growth, and impact at Caldera.

## Roles

- **[Software Engineer](roles/software-engineer.md)** — Execute and deliver
- **[Senior Software Engineer](roles/senior-software-engineer.md)** — Own delivery, discover solutions
- **[Principal Software Engineer](roles/principal-software-engineer.md)** — Discover solutions, identify problems
- **[Distinguished Software Engineer](roles/distinguished-software-engineer.md)** — Discover problems, shape strategy

## Framework

- **[Core Competencies](competencies.md)** — The 3 areas where all engineers develop: Craft, Impact, Leadership

## Our Philosophy

### Growth Through Demonstration
You earn responsibilities before titles. Engineers demonstrate readiness for the next level by consistently operating at that level. Title changes recognize what you're already doing, not what you might do.

### Three Dimensions of Growth

As you grow, three things expand simultaneously:

**Time Horizon** — How far ahead you work
- Software Engineer: 1-2 weeks (tasks → features)
- Senior Engineer: 1-3 months (features → projects)
- Principal Engineer: 3-6 months (projects → products)
- Distinguished Engineer: 6-12 months (products → company)

**Ownership** — What you're responsible for discovering
- Software Engineer: Execution → Delivery (given problem + solution, then problem + direction)
- Senior Engineer: Delivery → Solution Discovery (given problem + direction, then just problem)
- Principal Engineer: Solution Discovery → Problem Discovery (discover solutions, begin identifying problems)
- Distinguished Engineer: Problem Discovery + All Below (find problems worth solving, plus everything below)

**Scope** — Where your work creates value
- Software Engineer: Tasks → Features
- Senior Engineer: Features → Projects
- Principal Engineer: Projects → Products
- Distinguished Engineer: Products → Company

Each level adds responsibilities without replacing previous ones. A Distinguished Engineer still executes, delivers, and discovers solutions.

### Core Values

**Extreme Ownership** — Own outcomes, not just outputs. Take responsibility end-to-end. Follow through until value is delivered.

**Dual Impact** — Create value for clients AND strengthen Caldera. Both matter equally.

**Transparency** — Share work-in-progress, document decisions, make knowledge accessible. Learn and build in public.

**Excellence** — Set high standards for yourself and others. Challenge ideas with kindness. Celebrate wins and learn from setbacks together.

## How to Use This

**Read your role** to understand current expectations. **Read the next level** to see what growth looks like. **Use competencies** to assess yourself and identify development areas.

Remember: Growth happens through demonstration. Work at the next level to earn the promotion.
