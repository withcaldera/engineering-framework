# Software Engineer

## In Short

You execute on well-defined problems, delivering quality work with growing independence. You're building your craft, learning systems, and embodying Caldera's engineering principles.

---

## Scope

- **Time Horizon**: You focus on 1-2 week tasks and features, breaking down work into achievable pieces and delivering them consistently.

- **Ownership**: You own execution and delivery. Early on, you're given both a problem and a solution to implement. As you grow, you're given a problem and direction, then figure out how to deliver it.

- **Impact**: Your scope of impact is on individual tasks or features within a project. You complete well-defined pieces of work that contribute to larger efforts.

## What Good Looks Like

### Craft
*Building excellent software through technical skill, judgment, and continuous learning.*

- Write clean, tested code following team standards
- Learn patterns from the codebase and apply them
- Debug systematically and ask clarifying questions to deepen your understanding
- Seek feedback and incorporate it into your work
- Grow your skills deliberately and share learnings with the team
- Document solutions to problems that others might encounter
- Leverage tools (AI or otherwise) that help you deliver quality work faster

### Impact
*Taking ownership, delivering outcomes, and creating value for clients and Caldera.*

- Complete assigned tasks with growing independence
- Follow through on commitments and meet deadlines
- Communicate blockers and challenges early, before they delay delivery
- Provide regular progress updates without being asked
- Clarify requirements when something is ambiguous rather than making assumptions
- Deliver features that work as specified
- Understand how your work serves client needs

### Leadership
*Growing others, building shared understanding, and multiplying effectiveness.*

- Learn from feedback and coaching
- Offer to help teammates when you have relevant knowledge
- Share resources or approaches that helped you solve similar problems
- Participate actively in code reviews
- Ask questions that help the team
- Contribute positively to team culture through your communications

## Examples

You're operating at this level when people see you doing these things:

- Posting pull requests with clear descriptions, tests, and implementation that follows team patterns
- Asking clarifying questions in Slack/tickets when requirements are unclear, before implementing
- Sharing daily progress updates that show consistent delivery on 1-2 week tasks
- Commenting thoughtfully on others' PRs with questions about edge cases or code quality
- Documenting your debugging process when you hit blockers, showing systematic troubleshooting
- Sharing which tools or approaches helped you deliver work faster while maintaining quality

*In a remote organization, your work must be visible to be valued. These are the observable signals that you're delivering at this level.*

## Ready for Senior When...

You consistently demonstrate these behaviors over 6+ months:

- **Completing features independently** (not just tasks)
- **Proposing solutions**, not just implementing them
- **Anticipating problems** before they become blockers
- **Planning 1-3 months ahead**, not just 1-2 weeks
- **Helping unblock teammates** proactively
- **Influencing team practices** through your contributions

**Note**: Most engineers reach Senior level with 2-4 years of experience.
