# Software Engineer

## Overview

Software Engineers are the foundation of our engineering team. You execute on well-defined problems and solutions, delivering quality work with growing independence. You're building your craft, learning systems, and beginning to embody Caldera's engineering principles.

---

## Scope & Responsibilities

### Time Horizon
**1-2 weeks** — You plan and execute individual tasks and features within a sprint.

### Ownership
**Execution → Delivery Process** — You start by being given both the problem and the solution approach (execution), and transition into being given the problem and direction while you define the solution (delivery process).

### Scope
**Tasks → Features** — You start with individual tasks and transition into owning entire features that deliver value to clients.

## Growth Indicators

You're ready to operate at the Senior level when you:

### Expanding Scope
- Consistently complete features (not just tasks) independently
- Start planning and executing 1-3 months of work, not just 1-2 weeks
- Transition from features into owning small projects
- Propose solutions, not just implement them
- Take responsibility for the feature's success, not just code completion

### Deeper Ownership
- Anticipate problems before they become blockers
- Improve code and processes without being asked
- Help unblock teammates proactively
- Follow features through to production and monitor their impact

### Broader Impact
- Your work influences how others approach similar problems
- You actively shape team practices through your contributions
- You mentor newer engineers informally
- Your code reviews improve others' code quality

### Technical Growth
- You understand trade-offs in technical decisions
- You can design small features end-to-end
- You identify and address technical debt
- You contribute to architecture discussions

## Success Looks Like

### After 3 Months
- Completing assigned tasks with minimal guidance
- Writing code that passes review without major changes
- Understanding your team's systems and workflows
- Contributing to team discussions and ceremonies

### After 6 Months
- Taking ownership of small features end-to-end
- Providing helpful feedback in code reviews
- Proactively identifying and communicating issues
- Demonstrating consistent velocity and quality

### After 12-24 Months
- Operating independently on most assigned work
- Helping onboard newer team members
- Contributing to technical discussions and decisions
- Starting to demonstrate Senior-level behaviors regularly

**Note**: Most engineers reach Senior level with 2-4 years of experience, demonstrating consistent ownership of features and delivery process.

## Example Scenarios

**Executing on a Feature**
- Receive: "Build a password reset email feature using our email service"
- You: Implement the feature, write tests, handle errors, create the PR, respond to feedback, merge and verify in staging

**Handling Ambiguity**
- Situation: Requirement says "user-friendly error messages" but doesn't specify format
- You: Ask for clarification with 2-3 examples of what you're considering, then implement based on feedback

**Being Blocked**
- Situation: API endpoint you need isn't working
- You: Try basic debugging, check documentation, then reach out with context: "I'm working on X, need API Y, tried Z, getting error A. Could you help?"

**Contributing to Culture**
- Review a teammate's PR thoughtfully
- Share a useful article or tool with the team
- Ask good questions in planning meetings
- Celebrate team wins in Slack
