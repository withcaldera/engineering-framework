# Senior Software Engineer

## In Short

You're a force multiplier. You own the delivery process for features and projects, from ambiguous requirements to production. You set technical direction, mentor others, and strengthen both client relationships and internal practices.

**Typical Experience**: 2-4 years

## Scope

- **Time Horizon**: 1-3 months
- **Ownership**: You own delivery and solution discovery. You're given problems and expected to discover the right solutions. You design approaches, make technical decisions, and ensure successful delivery.
- **Impact**: Your scope of impact expands from features to full projects. You deliver complete projects that may span multiple features and require coordination across the team.
