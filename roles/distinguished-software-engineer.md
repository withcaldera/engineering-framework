## Distinguished vs Principal

**Critical Understanding**: Both roles execute, deliver, and discover solutions. Distinguished adds consistent problem discovery and company-level strategic ownership.

**Ownership**
- Principal: Solution Discovery → Problem Discovery (beginning to identify problems)
- Distinguished: Problem Discovery (+ all below) — consistently find problems worth solving

**Time & Impact**
- Principal: 3-6 months, Projects → Products
- Distinguished: 6-12 months, Products → Company

**Leadership**
- Principal: Leading teams through technical excellence
- Distinguished: Shaping organizational capabilities and strategy

A Distinguished Engineer still writes code, delivers features, and solves technical problems—they do everything a Principal does PLUS shape what problems the company solves.
