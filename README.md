# Caldera Engineering Framework

This framework defines what "operating at the next level" actually looks like for our team (through observable behaviors, expanding scope, and measurable impact.) Whether you're executing your first tasks or shaping company strategy, you'll find clear expectations for where you are and concrete guidance for where you're going.

## Roles

- **[Software Engineer](roles/01-software-engineer.md)** — Execute and deliver
- **[Senior Software Engineer](roles/02-senior-software-engineer.md)** — Own delivery, discover solutions
- **[Principal Software Engineer](roles/03-principal-software-engineer.md)** — Discover solutions, identify problems
- **[Distinguished Software Engineer](roles/04-distinguished-software-engineer.md)** — Discover problems, shape strategy
- **[Head of Engineering](roles/05-head-of-engineering.md)** — Lead organization, set strategy

## Framework

- **[Core Competencies](competencies.md)** — The 3 areas where all engineers develop: Craft, Impact, Leadership

## Our Philosophy

### Growth Through Demonstration
You earn responsibilities before titles. Engineers demonstrate readiness for the next level by consistently operating at that level. Title changes recognize what you're already doing, not what you might do.

### Three Dimensions of Growth

As you grow, three things expand simultaneously:

**Time Horizon** — How far ahead you work
- Software Engineer: 1-2 week tasks or features
- Senior Engineer: 1-3 month features or projects
- Principal Engineer: 3-6 month projects or products
- Distinguished Engineer: 6-12 months products or company

**Ownership** — What you're responsible for discovering

- **Software Engineer:** You own execution and delivery. Early on, you're given both a problem and a solution to implement. As you grow, you're given a problem and direction, then figure out how to deliver it.

- **Senior Engineer:** You own delivery and solution discovery. You're given problems and expected to discover the right solutions. You design approaches, make technical decisions, and ensure successful delivery.

- **Principal Engineer:** You own solution discovery and begin identifying problems. You discover solutions to complex problems and start recognizing important problems that need solving before they're escalated to you.

- **Distinguished Engineer:** You own problem discovery across all areas. You identify the most important problems worth solving, plus everything below—discovering solutions, owning delivery, and executing when needed.

**Scope** — Where your work creates value

- **Software Engineer:** Your scope of impact is on individual tasks or features within a project. You complete well-defined pieces of work that contribute to larger efforts.

- **Senior Engineer:** Your scope of impact expands from features to full projects. You deliver complete projects that may span multiple features and require coordination across the team.

- **Principal Engineer:** Your scope of impact grows from projects to products. You shape entire products or major product areas, ensuring they deliver value over quarters.

- **Distinguished Engineer:** Your scope of impact extends from products to company-level initiatives. Your work influences multiple products, sets technical direction, and shapes company strategy.

Each level adds responsibilities without replacing previous ones. A Distinguished Engineer still executes, delivers, and discovers solutions.

### Understanding Scope

Different levels of scope represent the breadth and duration of impact:

- **Task:** A discrete piece of work that can be completed independently, typically within days. Examples: fixing a bug, implementing a specific function, writing a test suite.

- **Feature:** A user-facing capability that delivers value, typically composed of multiple tasks and completed within 1-2 weeks. Examples: adding authentication to an app, building a new dashboard view, implementing export functionality.

- **Project:** A coordinated effort with defined outcomes, typically spanning 1-3 months and involving multiple features. Examples: rebuilding a service's API layer, migrating to a new database, launching a new client integration.

- **Product:** A complete offering that solves user problems and evolves over time, typically measured in quarters or years. Examples: an entire application platform, a core service that powers multiple features, a complete client solution.

- **Company:** Strategic initiatives that shape organizational direction and impact multiple products or the entire business. Examples: defining technical architecture standards, establishing engineering culture and practices, driving major platform decisions.

### Working Visibly in a Remote Organization

**Your work must be visible to be valued.** As a distributed remote team, we don't have the natural visibility that comes from sitting together. If people can't see your impact, they can't recognize it.

**Work in public, not in private.** Share your thinking, progress, and decisions where others can see them:
- Post updates proactively in shared channels
- Document your work and decisions as you go
- Share blockers and ask questions publicly
- Make your contributions observable and discoverable

**Perception matters as much as performance.** In remote work, perception IS reality. The quality of your work matters, but equally important is whether that work is visible to your team, clients, and leadership. Operating at a level means demonstrating those behaviors where others can see them.

**Over-communicate intentionally.** What feels like over-sharing to you is often exactly the right amount of visibility for a remote team. Regular updates, clear documentation, and public collaboration are how we stay aligned and recognize impact.

This is about making your valuable work visible so the team can learn from it, build on it, and recognize it.

### AI-Augmented Engineering

**AI is fundamentally changing how we engineer software.** It's shifting our focus from technical menial tasks to strategy, user understanding, and value delivery. This changes expectations at every level.

**Favor pragmatic delivery over perfect architecture.** AI enables us to validate ideas faster. We prioritize quick delivery of value to market, learning from real usage, and iterating. This means being strategic about where we invest effort.

**Make decisions with consent, not consensus.** Document your thinking clearly. Get input from the right people. Make the call and move forward. AI helps us execute faster, which means slow decision-making becomes the bottleneck.

**Adopt tools that multiply your impact.** We don't dictate tooling, but we expect engineers to continuously evaluate and adopt tools (AI or otherwise) that help deliver more value faster. Meeting evolving client and peer expectations for speed and quality is part of the job.

**New opportunities to create value:**
- Evangelizing AI technologies that multiply engineer effectiveness and client value
- Implementing AI in CI/CD pipelines to improve delivery speed and quality
- Applying AI to development processes to find bugs earlier, deliver faster, spend more time on strategy
- Using AI to enhance testing, documentation, code review, and knowledge sharing

AI is amplifying engineering judgment. The better you are at traditional engineering practices, the more effectively you'll leverage AI. Strong fundamentals in architecture, system design, and software craftsmanship become more valuable, not less.

### Core Values

**Extreme Ownership** — Own outcomes, not just outputs. Take responsibility end-to-end. Follow through until value is delivered.

**Dual Impact** — Create value for clients AND strengthen Caldera. Both matter equally.

**Transparency** — Share work-in-progress, document decisions, make knowledge accessible. Learn and build in public.

**Excellence** — Set high standards for yourself and others. Challenge ideas with kindness. Celebrate wins and learn from setbacks together.

## How to Use This

**Read your role** to understand current expectations. **Read the next level** to see what growth looks like. **Use competencies** to assess yourself and identify development areas.

Remember: Growth happens through demonstration. Work at the next level to earn the promotion.
