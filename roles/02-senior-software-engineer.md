# Senior Software Engineer

## In Short

You're a force multiplier. You own the delivery process for features and projects, from ambiguous requirements to production. You set technical direction, mentor others, and strengthen both client relationships and internal practices.

---

## Scope

- **Time Horizon**: You focus on 1-3 month features and projects, planning ahead to deliver cohesive solutions that create sustained value.

- **Ownership**: You own delivery and solution discovery. You're given problems and expected to discover the right solutions. You design approaches, make technical decisions, and ensure successful delivery.

- **Impact**: Your scope of impact expands from features to full projects. You deliver complete projects that may span multiple features and require coordination across the team.

## Examples

What does this look like in practice? Here are specific things you might be doing:

- Designing and implementing a complete payment processing feature, from database schema to frontend UI, making architectural decisions about error handling and retry logic
- Leading a technical spike to evaluate three different approaches for real-time notifications, presenting trade-offs to the team and recommending a solution
- Pairing with a junior engineer to help them understand the codebase's authentication system, showing them patterns and explaining why certain decisions were made
- Identifying that the current deployment process is causing issues, proposing and implementing improvements to make it more reliable
- Meeting with a client to understand their evolving requirements for a reporting feature, then scoping out the technical work and breaking it into deliverable iterations

## Ready for Principal When...

You consistently demonstrate these behaviors over 6+ months:

- **Planning and delivering 3-6 month projects** (not just 1-3 month features)
- **Owning solution discovery consistently** and beginning to identify problems worth solving
- **Influencing technical strategy** across multiple projects
- **Other engineers seek your input** on technical decisions
- **Solving problems that span** multiple clients or projects
- **Thinking about long-term technical health**, not just immediate delivery

**Note**: Most engineers reach Principal level with 4-8 years total experience.
